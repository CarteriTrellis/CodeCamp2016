<p>There are no slides for my "Rider: Adventures in Cross-Platform Development" because that was terrible. My sincere apologies for the folks who attended, and my thanks for those who participated in the discussion about their current experiences with and the future of .NET cross-platform development.</p>

<p>There are, however, slides for "A Year of Robots: Teens, Tech, and Transformations"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When looking for volunteer or other community activities, it's natural to turn to those opportunities that arise close to home. My son chose his current high school in no small part on the basis of their robotics club; seeing how involved and self-directed he was, I thought this would be a great opportunity to share an experience with him and at the same time help youth with an interest in tech gain a better understanding of "real world" software practices.  </p>

<p>Boy, did that go out the window fast. I got a school-year-long lesson in the ins and outs of volunteering, mentoring, and more specifically, in the challenges of mentoring kids who are not your own.  </p>

<p>Come hear how lofty goals collided with reality, how I learned more about robots than I ever intended to, and how, in general, I learned far more from these young adults than I could ever hope to impart to them.</p>

<p>I've also included a list of the videos that I intended to use during the presentation. I would up showing about half of them, but I thought I'd include the entire list as there's some additional fun stuff to see there.</p>
